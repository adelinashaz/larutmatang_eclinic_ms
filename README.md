Larut Matang E-Clinic Management System were developed to serve as my Final Year Project. 


The Larut Matang E-Clinic Management System is a system that are used to assist the admin, doctors and patients to book appointments, 
monitor clinic’s medicine and also getting patients’ report online. 
The front end of the system is implemented using PHP file styles, and the back end is implemented using MySQL. 
This foundation was created for the system and made Windows 10 feasible.
The clinic uses a manual process. Without the aid of any system, it manages report and appointment manually. 
There are three modules in this project which handles patient, medicine and also appointment. A certain user role is allocated to each module. 
This plan would make the exchange of after-care information simpler and allow the personnel monitor the clinic’s services. 

Problem Statement ;
1. The current clinic management system is time consuming because they must go through a complex process in order to schedule an appointment.
2. Since the clinic still uses the manila card to retain patient records, it requires more space.
3. The clinic’s ability to schedule appointments is being affected by the growing number of patients, as all appointment dates are still recorded in books.

Objectives ;
1. To provide an online appointment system.
2. To fully automate the clinic’s everyday operations.
3. To provide a function that allows the clinic’s staff to sort the appointment dates automatically with just one click.
